## Overview

IBM Cloud App Configuration is a centralized feature management and configuration service
on [IBM Cloud](https://www.cloud.ibm.com) for use with web and mobile applications, microservices, and distributed
environments.

Instrument your applications with App Configuration Ruby SDK, and use the App Configuration dashboard, CLI or API to
define feature flags or properties, organized into collections and targeted to segments. Toggle feature flag states in
the cloud to activate or deactivate features in your application or environment, when required. Run experiments and measure the effect of feature flags on end users by tracking custom metrics. You can also manage the properties for distributed applications centrally.

## Installation

Installation is done using the `gem install` command or by adding it to your Gemfile.

```bash
gem install ibm_appconfiguration_ruby_sdk --pre
```

Or add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "ibm_appconfiguration_ruby_sdk", "0.1.0.pre.rc.1"
```

And then execute:

```bash
bundle install
```

## Import the SDK

To import the module:

```ruby
require "ibm_appconfiguration_ruby_sdk"
```

## Usage

Initialize the SDK to connect with your App Configuration service instance.

```ruby
require "ibm_appconfiguration_ruby_sdk"

region         = "us-south"
guid           = "<guid>"
apikey         = "<apikey>"
collection_id  = "airlines-webapp"
environment_id = "dev"

# (Optional) SDK-wide options — call before .instance
IbmAppconfigurationRubySdk::AppConfiguration.configure do |config|
  config.debug                = false  # set true for verbose SDK logging
  config.use_private_endpoint = false  # set true to use IBM private network
end

# Get the singleton instance
client = IbmAppconfigurationRubySdk::AppConfiguration.instance

# Initialize the SDK — keyword arguments are required
client.init(region: region, guid: guid, apikey: apikey)

# Register a listener before set_context so it fires on the very first config fetch
client.register_configuration_update_listener do
  # called on every configuration refresh (initial load + live updates)
end

# Set context
client.set_context(collection_id, environment_id)
```

> :warning: It is expected that initialization to be done **only once**.

After the SDK is initialized successfully, the feature flags & properties can be retrieved using the `client` as shown in the below code snippet.

<details><summary>Expand to view the example snippet</summary>

```ruby
# Get feature
feature = client.get_feature("online-check-in")
if feature
  result = feature.get_current_value(entity_id, entity_attributes)
  puts result.value
end

# Get property
property = client.get_property("check-in-charges")
if property
  result = property.get_current_value(entity_id, entity_attributes)
  puts result.value
end
```
</details>

where,
- **region**: Region name where the App Configuration service instance is created.
  See list of supported locations [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/app-configuration). Eg:- `us-south`, `au-syd`, `eu-gb`, `us-east`, `eu-de`, `ca-tor`, `jp-tok`, `jp-osa` etc.
- **guid**: Instance Id of the App Configuration service. Obtain it from the service credentials section of the App
  Configuration dashboard.
- **apikey**: ApiKey of the App Configuration service. Obtain it from the service credentials section of the App
  Configuration dashboard.
- **collection_id**: Id of the collection created in App Configuration service instance under the **Collections** section.
- **environment_id**: Id of the environment created in App Configuration service instance under the **Environments** section.

### Connect using private network connection (optional)

Set the SDK to connect to App Configuration service by using a private endpoint that is accessible only through the IBM Cloud private network. This must be configured before calling `init`.

Via the `configure` block (preferred):

```ruby
IbmAppconfigurationRubySdk::AppConfiguration.configure do |config|
  config.use_private_endpoint = true
end
```

Or directly on the client instance (must be called before `init`):

```ruby
client.use_private_endpoint(true)
```

### (Optional)

In order for your application and SDK to continue its operations even during the unlikely scenario of App Configuration service across your application restarts, you can configure the SDK to work using a persistent cache. The SDK uses the persistent cache to store the App Configuration data that will be available across your application restarts.

```ruby
client.set_context(collection_id, environment_id,
  persistent_cache_directory: "/var/lib/docker/volumes/"
)
```

* **persistent_cache_directory**: Absolute path to a directory which has read & write permission for the user. The SDK will create a file - `appconfiguration.json` in the specified directory, and it will be used as the persistent cache to store the App Configuration service information.

When persistent cache is enabled, the SDK will keep the last known good configuration at the persistent cache. In the case of App Configuration server being unreachable, the latest configurations at the persistent cache is loaded to the application to continue working.

Please ensure that the cache file is not lost or deleted in any case. For example, consider the case when a kubernetes pod is restarted and the cache file (appconfiguration.json) was stored in ephemeral volume of the pod. As pod gets restarted, kubernetes destroys the ephemeral volume in the pod, as a result the cache file gets deleted. So, make sure that the cache file created by the SDK is always stored in persistent volume by providing the correct absolute path of the persistent directory.

### (Optional)

The SDK is also designed to serve configurations, perform feature flag & property evaluations without being connected to App Configuration service.

```ruby
client.set_context(collection_id, environment_id,
  bootstrap_file: "saflights/flights.json",
  live_config_update_enabled: false
)
```

This usecase will throw error if given `bootstrap_file` is not found or if unable to parse the json coming from the bootstrap file.

* **bootstrap_file**: Absolute path of the JSON file, which contains configuration details. Make sure to provide a proper JSON file. You can generate this file using `ibmcloud ac export` command of the IBM Cloud App Configuration CLI.
* **live_config_update_enabled**: Live configuration update from the server. Set this value to `false` if the new configuration values shouldn't be fetched from the server.

## Get single feature

```ruby
feature = client.get_feature("online-check-in") # feature can be nil in case of an invalid feature id

if feature
  puts "Feature Name: #{feature.name}"
  puts "Feature Id: #{feature.feature_id}"
  puts "Feature Type: #{feature.type}"
  if feature.enabled?
    # feature flag is enabled
  else
    # feature flag is disabled
  end
end
```

## Get all features

```ruby
features = client.features
feature = features["online-check-in"]

if feature
  puts "Feature Name: #{feature.name}"
  puts "Feature Id: #{feature.feature_id}"
  puts "Feature Type: #{feature.type}"
  puts "Is feature enabled? #{feature.enabled?}"
end
```

## Evaluate a feature

Use the `feature.get_current_value(entity_id, entity_attributes)` method to evaluate the value of the feature flag. This method returns an `EvaluationResult` struct containing the evaluated value, feature flag enabled status, and evaluation details.

```ruby
entity_id = "john_doe"
entity_attributes = {
  city: "Bangalore",
  country: "India"
}

result = feature.get_current_value(entity_id, entity_attributes)
puts result.value    # Evaluated value of the feature flag. The type matches the feature flag type (Boolean, String, Numeric).
puts result.enabled  # enabled status (true/false).
puts result.details  # an EvaluationDetails struct with detailed evaluation information. See below.

# the `result.details` struct has the following fields:
puts result.details.value_type                  # e.g. "DISABLED_VALUE"
puts result.details.rollout_percentage_applied  # (only if applicable, else nil) Boolean
puts result.details.segment_name               # (only if applicable, else nil) e.g. "premium-users"
puts result.details.error_type                 # (only if applicable, else nil) error message if evaluation failed
```

- **entity_id**: Id of the Entity. This will be a string identifier related to the Entity against which the feature is evaluated. For example, an entity might be an instance of an app that runs on a mobile device, a microservice that runs on the cloud, or a component of infrastructure that runs that microservice. For any entity to interact with App Configuration, it must provide a unique entity ID.
- **entity_attributes**: A Hash consisting of the attribute name and their values that defines the specified entity. This is an optional parameter if the feature flag is not configured with any targeting definition. If the targeting is configured, then entity_attributes should be provided for the rule evaluation. An attribute is a parameter that is used to define a segment. The SDK uses the attribute values to determine if the specified entity satisfies the targeting rules, and returns the appropriate feature flag value.

## Get single property

```ruby
property = client.get_property("check-in-charges") # property can be nil in case of an invalid property id

if property
  puts "Property Name: #{property.name}"
  puts "Property Id: #{property.property_id}"
  puts "Property Type: #{property.type}"
end
```

## Get all properties

```ruby
properties = client.properties
property = properties["check-in-charges"]

if property
  puts "Property Name: #{property.name}"
  puts "Property Id: #{property.property_id}"
  puts "Property Type: #{property.type}"
end
```

## Evaluate a property

Use the `property.get_current_value(entity_id, entity_attributes)` method to evaluate the value of the property. This method returns an `EvaluationResult` struct containing the evaluated value and evaluation details.

```ruby
entity_id = "john_doe"
entity_attributes = {
  city: "Bangalore",
  country: "India"
}

result = property.get_current_value(entity_id, entity_attributes)
puts result.value    # Evaluated value of the property. The type matches the property type (Boolean, String, Numeric).
puts result.details  # an EvaluationDetails struct with detailed evaluation information. See below.

# the `result.details` struct has the following fields:
puts result.details.value_type   # e.g. "DEFAULT_VALUE"
puts result.details.segment_name # (only if applicable, else nil) e.g. "premium-users"
puts result.details.error_type   # (only if applicable, else nil) error message if evaluation failed
```

- **entity_id**: Id of the Entity. This will be a string identifier related to the Entity against which the property is evaluated. For example, an entity might be an instance of an app that runs on a mobile device, a microservice that runs on the cloud, or a component of infrastructure that runs that microservice. For any entity to interact with App Configuration, it must provide a unique entity ID.
- **entity_attributes**: A Hash consisting of the attribute name and their values that defines the specified entity. This is an optional parameter if the property is not configured with any targeting definition. If the targeting is configured, then entity_attributes should be provided for the rule evaluation. An attribute is a parameter that is used to define a segment. The SDK uses the attribute values to determine if the specified entity satisfies the targeting rules, and returns the appropriate property value.

## Get secret property

Explicit method for getting the secret references stored in App Configuration.

```ruby
secret_property_object = client.get_secret(property_id, secrets_manager_service)
```

- **property_id**: property_id is the unique string identifier, using this we will be able to fetch the property which will provide the necessary metadata to fetch the secret.
- **secrets_manager_service**: an initialized secrets manager client, which will be used for getting the secret data during the secret property evaluation. Create a secret manager client by referring the doc: https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/secrets-manager/secrets-manager-v2?code=ruby#authentication

## Evaluate a secret property

Use the `secret_property_object.get_current_value(entity_id, entity_attributes)` method to evaluate the value of the secret property.

Note that the output of this method call is different from `get_current_value` invoked using feature & property objects. This method returns the actual secret value of the evaluated secret reference. The response contains the secret data from the Secrets Manager.

```ruby
entity_id = "john_doe"
entity_attributes = {
  city: "Bangalore",
  country: "India"
}

begin
  response = secret_property_object.get_current_value(entity_id, entity_attributes)
  # See below to know how to access the secret data from the response
rescue StandardError => e
  # handle the error
end
```

## Fetching the client across other modules

Once the SDK is initialized, the client can be obtained across other modules as shown below:

```ruby
# **other modules**

require "ibm_appconfiguration_ruby_sdk"

client = IbmAppconfigurationRubySdk::AppConfiguration.instance

feature = client.get_feature("online-check-in")
result  = feature.get_current_value(entity_id, entity_attributes)
puts result.value
puts result.enabled
```

## Error handling

The SDK raises typed errors that you can rescue individually or collectively.

```ruby
begin
  client.init(region: region, guid: guid, apikey: apikey)
  client.set_context(collection_id, environment_id)
rescue IbmAppconfigurationRubySdk::AuthenticationError => e
  # HTTP 401 — invalid or expired API key
  warn "Authentication failed (HTTP #{e.http_status}): #{e.message}"
rescue IbmAppconfigurationRubySdk::APIError => e
  # Any other HTTP error from the service
  warn "API error (HTTP #{e.http_status}): #{e.message}"
rescue IbmAppconfigurationRubySdk::ConfigurationError => e
  # SDK used incorrectly — e.g. missing init parameters
  warn "SDK configuration error: #{e.message}"
end
```

Error class hierarchy:

| Class | Trigger |
| --- | --- |
| `IbmAppconfigurationRubySdk::Error` | Base class — rescue this to catch all SDK errors |
| `IbmAppconfigurationRubySdk::ConfigurationError` | Incorrect SDK usage (missing params, wrong call order) |
| `IbmAppconfigurationRubySdk::APIError` | HTTP error from the service (carries `http_status` & `http_body`) |
| `IbmAppconfigurationRubySdk::AuthenticationError` | HTTP 401 |
| `IbmAppconfigurationRubySdk::RateLimitError` | HTTP 429 |
| `IbmAppconfigurationRubySdk::InvalidRequestError` | HTTP 400 / 422 |
| `IbmAppconfigurationRubySdk::ServerError` | HTTP 5xx |

## Supported Data types

App Configuration service allows to configure the feature flag and properties in the following data types: Boolean,
Numeric, SecretRef, String. The String data type can be of the format of a text string, JSON or YAML. The SDK processes each
format accordingly as shown in the below table.

For property of type secret reference, refer to readme section [evaluate-a-secret-property](#evaluate-a-secret-property)
</details>

<details><summary>Feature flag</summary>

```ruby
feature = client.get_feature("json-feature")
feature.type        # STRING
feature.data_format # JSON

# Example (traversing the returned Hash)
result = feature.get_current_value(entity_id, entity_attributes)
puts result.value["key"] # prints the value of the key

feature = client.get_feature("yaml-feature")
feature.type        # STRING
feature.data_format # YAML
feature.get_current_value(entity_id, entity_attributes)
```
</details>

<details><summary>Property</summary>

```ruby
property = client.get_property("json-property")
property.type        # STRING
property.data_format # JSON

# Example (traversing the returned Hash)
result = property.get_current_value(entity_id, entity_attributes)
puts result.value["key"] # prints the value of the key

property = client.get_property("yaml-property")
property.type        # STRING
property.data_format # YAML
property.get_current_value(entity_id, entity_attributes)
```
</details>

## Set listener for feature and property data changes

The SDK provides a callback mechanism to notify you in real-time when feature flag's or property's configuration changes. Register the listener after `init` but before `set_context` so it fires on the very first configuration fetch.

```ruby
client.register_configuration_update_listener do
  # **add your code**
  # To find the effect of any configuration changes, you can call the feature or property related methods

  # feature = client.get_feature("online-check-in")
  # new_result = feature.get_current_value(entity_id, entity_attributes)
end
```

## Enable debugger (optional)

Use this method to enable/disable the logging in SDK.

```ruby
# Via the configure block (call before .instance)
IbmAppconfigurationRubySdk::AppConfiguration.configure do |config|
  config.debug = true
end

# Or directly on the client instance
client.set_debug(true)
```

## Examples

Try [this](./examples) sample application in the examples folder to learn more about feature and property evaluation.

## Adding URLs to your allowlist

This SDK requires connectivity to the internet (if bootstrap based initialization is not done). The endpoints listed below should be reachable from the host/infrastructure where this SDK will run.

```
https://cloud.ibm.com:443
https://iam.cloud.ibm.com:443
https://{region}.apprapp.cloud.ibm.com:443
wss://{region}.apprapp.cloud.ibm.com:443
```

If opted for private endpoint by setting `config.use_private_endpoint = true` (or `client.use_private_endpoint(true)`) then the allowlist will be

```
https://cloud.ibm.com:443
https://private.iam.cloud.ibm.com:443
https://private.{region}.apprapp.cloud.ibm.com:443
wss://private.{region}.apprapp.cloud.ibm.com:443
```

where `region` is the region where your App Configuration service instance is provisioned such as `us-south`, `us-east`, `eu-gb`, `au-syd`, `eu-de`, `ca-tor`, `jp-tok`, `jp-osa` etc.
